Based on the uploaded image, perform the following transformations:

His left hand is knocking on the window, and his right hand is pointing at the alien ships in the background. His expression should show urgency and concern, as if warning of imminent danger.

Step 3: Add dramatic effects to enhance the crisis atmosphere: explosions in the distance with bright orange and red fire, billowing smoke clouds, debris flying through the air, and lens flare from the explosions.

- Professional quotes: Neutrals with accent colors
